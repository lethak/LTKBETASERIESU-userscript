# Troubleshooting

* Sometimes, chrome and firefox will disable tampermonkey or greasemonkey  for some reasons.
* Please make sure they are installed and enabled before opening any issue here.

## Mobile/Tablet
I have not managed to make the script work on mobile or tablet. If you have any clue on how to do it, please create a new issue detailing a solution.

## Greasemonkey and Firefox Quantum
For [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) users, the script is having troubles with Firefox since the "Quantum" update (version >= 57), this is why the latest version of  [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) is now recommended for all browsers.

Compatibility:

| -  | Firefox < 57 |  Firefox Quantum >= 57 | Chrome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tampermonkey >= 4.x* | - | OK | OK* |
| Tampermonkey <= 3.x | OK | Broken | OK |
| Greasemonkey <= 3.x | OK | Broken | OK |
| Greasemonkey >= 4.x | - | Broken | ? |

(*) *recommended*
